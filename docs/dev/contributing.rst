Contributor's Guide
===================

If you're reading this, you're probably interested in contributing to Cybsi.
Thank you very much!

Code Contributions
------------------

Code Review
~~~~~~~~~~~

Contributions will not be merged until they've been code reviewed.

Code Style
~~~~~~~~~~

Formatting is performed using ``make lint``. There are no compromises.

Documentation Contributions
---------------------------

Documentation improvements are always welcome! The documentation files live in
the ``docs/`` directory of the codebase. They're written in
`reStructuredText`_, and use `Sphinx`_ to generate the full suite of
documentation.

When contributing documentation, please do your best to follow the style of the
documentation files. This means a soft-limit of 79 characters wide in your text
files and a semi-formal, yet friendly and approachable, prose style.

When presenting Python code, use single-quoted strings (``'hello'`` instead of
``"hello"``).
