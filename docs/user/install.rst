Installation of Cybsi SDK
=========================

Latest version and its dependencies
-----------------------------------------------
We host SDK on PyPI registry.

To install it from registry, simply run the following command in your terminal of choice:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip3 install cybsi-sdk

``pip3`` will ask you for credentials.

You can also get a specific version by running a command like ``pip3 install cybsi-sdk==0.0.14``.

Source code
-----------

.. code-block:: console

TODO: add example of git clone command.

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python package, or install it into your site-packages easily:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd cybsi-python-sdk
  $ python -m pip install .
